title: "Getting Started"
description: "Fit an LSTM and NHITS model"
---

This notebook provides an example on how to start using the main functionalities of the [NeuralForecast](/neuralforecast/api-reference/core) library. The NeuralForecast class allows users to easily interact with `NeuralForecast.models` PyTorch models. In this example we will forecast AirPassengers data with a classic [LSTM](/neuralforecast/api-reference/models-documentation/lstm) and the recent [NHITS](/neuralforecast/api-reference/models-documentation/nhits) models. The full list of available models is available [here](/neuralforecast/api-reference/core).

You can run these experiments using GPU with Google Colab.

## 1. Installing NeuralForecast

```sql
!pip install neuralforecast
```

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from neuralforecast import NeuralForecast
from neuralforecast.models import LSTM, NHITS, RNN
from neuralforecast.utils import AirPassengersDF
```

## 2. Loading AirPassengers Data

The `core.NeuralForecast` class contains shared, `fit`, `predict` and other methods that take as inputs pandas DataFrames with columns `['unique_id', 'ds', 'y']`, where `unique_id` identifies individual time series from the dataset, `ds` is the date, and `y` is the target variable.

In this example dataset consists of a set of a single series, but you can easily fit your model to larger datasets in long format.

```cs
Y_df = AirPassengersDF # Defined in neuralforecast.utils
Y_df.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds         | y     |
| --- | --------- | ---------- | ----- |
| 0   | 1.0       | 1949-01-31 | 112.0 |
| 1   | 1.0       | 1949-02-28 | 118.0 |
| 2   | 1.0       | 1949-03-31 | 132.0 |
| 3   | 1.0       | 1949-04-30 | 129.0 |
| 4   | 1.0       | 1949-05-31 | 121.0 |

<Warning>
    DataFrames must include all `['unique_id', 'ds', 'y']` columns. Make sure y column does not have missing or non-numeric values.
</Warning>
