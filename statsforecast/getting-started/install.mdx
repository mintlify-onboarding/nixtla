You can install the released version of [`StatsForecast`](/statsforecast//api-reference/core#statsforecast        ) from the [Python package index](https://pypi.org/) with:

```
pip install statsforecast
```

<Warning>
  We are constantly updating StatsForecast, so we suggest fixing the version to
  avoid issues. `pip install statsforecast=="1.0.0"`

<Tip>
  We recommend installing your libraries inside a python virtual or [conda
  environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/macos.html).
