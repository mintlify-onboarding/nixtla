Follow this article for a step to step guide on building a production-ready forecasting pipeline for multiple time series.

During this guide you will gain familiary with the core StatsForecastclass and some relevant methods like StatsForecast.plot, StatsForecast.forecast and StatsForecast.cross_validation.

We will use a classical benchmarking dataset from the M4 competition. The dataset includes time series from different domains like finance, economy and sales. In this example, we will use a subset of the Hourly dataset.

We will model each time series individually. Forecasting at this level is also known as local forecasting. Therefore, you will train a series of models for every unique series and then select the best one. StatsForecast focuses on speed, simplicity, and scalability, which makes it ideal for this task.

**Outline:**

1. Install packages.
2. Read the data.
3. Explore the data.
4. Train many models for every unique combination of time series.
5. Evaluate the model’s performance using cross-validation.
6. Select the best model for every unique time series.

## Install libraries

We assume you have StatsForecast already installed. Check this guide for instructions on how to install StatsForecast.

Additionally, we will install `s3fs` to read from the S3 Filesystem of AWS and `datasetsforecast` for common error metrics like MAE or MASE.

Install the necessary packages using `pip install statsforecast s3fs datasetsforecast` ``

## Read the data

We will use pandas to read the M4 Hourly data set stored in a parquet file for efficiency. You can use ordinary pandas operations to read your data in other formats likes `.csv`.

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in long format with three columns: `unique_id`, `ds` and `y`:

- The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier for the series.

- The `ds` (datestamp or int) column should be either an integer indexing time or a datestampe ideally like YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a timestamp.

- The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast. We will rename the

This data set already satisfies the requirement.

Depending on your internet connection, this step should take around 10 seconds.

```java
import pandas as pd

Y_df = pd.read_parquet('https://datasets-nixtla.s3.amazonaws.com/m4-hourly.parquet')

Y_df.head()
```

|     | unique_id | ds  | y     |
| --- | --------- | --- | ----- |
| 0   | H1        | 1   | 605.0 |
| 1   | H1        | 2   | 586.0 |
| 2   | H1        | 3   | 586.0 |
| 3   | H1        | 4   | 559.0 |
| 4   | H1        | 5   | 511.0 |

This dataset contains 414 unique series with 900 observations on average. For this example and reproducibility’s sake, we will select only 10 unique IDs and keep only the last week. Depending on your processing infrastructure feel free to select more or less series.

<Info>
    Processing time is dependent on the available computing resources. Running this example with the complete dataset takes around 10 minutes in a c5d.24xlarge (96 cores) instance from AWS.
</Info>

```java
uids = Y_df['unique_id'].unique()[:10] # Select 10 ids to make the example faster

Y_df = Y_df.query('unique_id in @uids') 

Y_df = Y_df.groupby('unique_id').tail(7 * 24) #Select last 7 days of data to make example faster
```

## Explore Data with the plot method

Plot some series using the plot method from the StatsForecast class. This method prints 8 random series from the dataset and is useful for basic EDA.

<Info>
    The `StatsForecast.plot` method uses Plotly as a defaul engine. You can change to MatPlotLib by setting `engine="matplotlib"`.
</Info>

```java
from statsforecast import StatsForecast

StatsForecast.plot(Y_df)
```
