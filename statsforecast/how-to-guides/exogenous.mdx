## Introduction

**Exogenous regressors** are variables that can affect the values of a time series. They may not be directly related to the variable that is beging forecasted, but they can still have an impact on it. Examples of exogenous regressors are weather data, economic indicators, or promotional sales. They are typically collected from external sources and by incorporating them into a forecasting model, they can improve the accuracy of our predictions.

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a good understanding of how to incorporate exogenous regressors into [StatsForecast’s](/statsforecast/api-reference/core#statsforecast) models. Furthermore, you’ll see how to evaluate their performance and decide whether or not they can help enhance the forecast.

## Install libraries

We assume that you have StatsForecast already installed. If not, check this guide for instructions on [how to install StatsForecast](/statsforecast/getting-started/install)

Install the necessary packages using `pip install statsforecast`

```python 
pip install statsforecast -U
```

## Load and explore the data

In this example, we’ll use a single time series from the [M5 Competition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207021001187#:~:text=The%20objective%20of%20the%20M5,the%20uncertainty%20around%20these%20forecasts.) dataset. This series represents the daily sales of a product in a Walmart store. We’ll first import the complete dataset from [datasetsforecast](https://github.com/Nixtla/datasetsforecast/tree/main/), which you can install using `pip install datasetsforecast`.

```python 
pip install datasetsforecast -U
```

```python 
from datasetsforecast.m5 import M5
```

The function to load the data is `M5.load`, which requieres the following argument.

- `directory`: (str) The directory where the data will be downloaded.

This function returns multiple outputs. We need the first two.

- `Y_df`: (pandas DataFrame) The target time series with columns [`unique_id`, `ds`, `y`].
- `X_df`: (pandas DataFrame) Exogenous time series with columns [`unique_id`, `ds`, exogenous regressors].

```python 
Y_df, X_df, *_ = M5.load('./data')
```

We now need to filter the dataset. The product-store combination that we’ll use in this notebook has `unique_id = FOODS_3_586_CA_3`. This time series was chosen because it is not [intermittent](https://nixtla.github.io/statsforecast/examples/intermittentdata.html) and has exogenous regressors that will be useful for forecasting.

```python 
# Filter data 
Y_ts = Y_df[Y_df['unique_id'] == 'FOODS_3_586_CA_3'].reset_index(drop = True)
X_ts = X_df[X_df['unique_id'] == 'FOODS_3_586_CA_3'].reset_index(drop = True)

Y_ts.head()
```

We can plot the sales of this product-store combination with the `statsforecast.plot` method from the [StatsForecast](/statsforecast/api-reference/core#statsforecast) class. This method has multiple parameters, and the requiered ones to generate the plots in this notebook are explained below.

- `df`: A pandas dataframe with columns [`unique_id`, `ds`, `y`].
- `forecasts_df`: A pandas dataframe with columns [`unique_id`, `ds`] and models.
- `engine`: str = `plotly`. It can also be `matplotlib`. `plotly` generates interactive plots, while `matplotlib` generates static plots.

```python
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
```

```python 
StatsForecast.plot(Y_ts)
```

The M5 Competition included several exogenous regressors. Here we’ll use the following two.

- `sell_price`: The price of the product for the given store. The price is provided per week.
- `snap_CA`: A binary variable indicating whether the store allows SNAP purchases (1 if yes, 0 otherwise). SNAP stands for Supplement Nutrition Assitance Program, and it gives individuals and families money to help them purchase food products.

```python 
X_ts = X_ts[['unique_id', 'ds', 'sell_price', 'snap_CA']]
X_ts.head()
```

Here the `unique_id` is a category, but for the exogenous regressors it needs to be a string.

```python 
X_ts['unique_id'] = X_ts.unique_id.astype(str)
```
We can plot the exogenous regressors using `plotly`. We could use `statsforecast.plot`, but then one of the regressors must be renamed `y`, and the name must be changed back to the original before generating the forecast.

```python 
StatsForecast.plot(X_ts)
```

From this plot, we can conclude that price has increased twice and that SNAP occurs at regular intervals.

## Split train/test set

In the M5 Competition, participants had to forecast sales for the last 28 days in the dataset. We’ll use the same forecast horizon and create the train and test sets accordingly.

```python 
# Extract dates for train and test set 
dates = Y_df['ds'].unique()
dtrain = dates[:-28]
dtest = dates[-28:]

Y_train = Y_ts.query('ds in @dtrain')
Y_test = Y_ts.query('ds in @dtest') 

X_train = X_ts.query('ds in @dtrain') 
X_test = X_ts.query('ds in @dtest')
```

## Add exogenous regressors

The exogenous regressors need to be place after the target variable `y`.

```python 
train = Y_train.merge(X_ts, how = 'left', on = ['unique_id', 'ds']) 
train.head()
```


## Create future exogenous regressors

We need to include the future values of the exogenous regressors so that we can produce the forecasts. Notice that we already have this information in `X_test`.

```python 
X_test.head()
```

<Note>
**Important**

If the future values of the exogenous regressors are not available, then they must be forecasted or the regressors need to be eliminated from the model. Without them, it is not possible to generate the forecast.
</Note>


## Train model

To generate the forecast, we’ll use [AutoARIMA](), which is one of the models available in StatsForecast that allows exogenous regressors. To use this model, we first need to import it from `statsforecast.models` and then we need to instatiate it. Given that we’re working with daily data, we need to set `season_length = 7`.

```python 
from statsforecast.models import AutoARIMA

# Create a list with the model and its instantiation parameters 
models = [AutoARIMA(season_length = 7)]
```

Next, we need to instantiate a new StatsForecast object, which has the following parameters.

- `df`: The dataframe with the training data.
- `models`: The list of models defined in the previous step.
- `freq`: A string indicating the frequency of the data. See [pandas’ available frequencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases).
- `n_jobs`: An integer that indicates the number of jobs used in parallel processing. Use -1 to select all cores.

```python 
sf = StatsForecast(
    models=models, 
    freq='D', 
    n_jobs=-1
)
```

Now we’re ready to generate the forecast. To do this, we’ll use the `forecast` method, which takes the following arguments.

- `h`: An integer that represents the forecast horizon. In this case, we’ll forecast the next 28 days.
- `X_df`: A pandas dataframe with the future values of the exogenous regressors.
- `level`: A list of floats with the confidence levels of the prediction intervals. For example, `level=[95]` means that the range of values should include the actual future value with probability 95%.

```python 
horizon = 28
level = [95]

fcst = sf.forecast(df=train, h=horizon, X_df=X_test, level=level)
fcst = fcst.reset_index()
fcst.head()
```

We can plot the forecasts with the `statsforecast.plot` method described above.

```python 
StatsForecast.plot(Y_ts, fcst, max_insample_length=28*2)
```

## Evaluate results

We’ll merge the test set and the forecast to evaluate the accuracy using the [mean absolute error (MAE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_error).

```python 
res = Y_test.merge(fcst, how='left', on=['unique_id', 'ds'])
res.head()
```

```python 
mae = abs(res['y']-res['AutoARIMA']).mean()
print('The MAE with exogenous regressors is '+str(round(mae,2)))
```

To check whether the exogenous regressors were useful or not, we need to generate the forecast again, now without them. To do this, we simple pass the dataframe wihtout exogenous variables to the `forecast` method. Notice that the data only includes `unique_id`, `ds`, and `y`. The forecast method no longer requieres the future values of the exogenous regressors `X_df`.

```python 
# univariate model 
fcst_u = sf.forecast(df=train[['unique_id', 'ds', 'y']], h=28)

res_u = Y_test.merge(fcst_u, how='left', on=['unique_id', 'ds'])
mae_u = abs(res_u['y']-res_u['AutoARIMA']).mean()
```

```python 
print('The MAE without exogenous regressors is '+str(round(mae_u,2)))
```

Hence, we can conclude that using `sell_price` and `snap_CA` as external regressors helped improve the forecast.
