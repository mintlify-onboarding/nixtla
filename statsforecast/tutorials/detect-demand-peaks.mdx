title: "Detect Demand Peaks"
description: "In this example we will show how to perform electricity load forecasting on the ERCOT (Texas) market for detecting daily peaks."

## Introduction

Predicting peaks in different markets is useful. In the electricity market, consuming electricity at peak demand is penalized with higher tarifs. When an individual or company consumes electricity when its most demanded, regulators calls that a coincident peak (CP).

In the Texas electricity market (ERCOT), the peak is the monthly 15-minute interval when the ERCOT Grid is at a point of highest capacity. The peak is caused by all consumersâ€™ combined demand on the electrical grid. The coincident peak demand is an important factor used by ERCOT to determine final electricity consumption bills. ERCOT registers the CP demand of each client for 4 months, between June and September, and uses this to adjust electricity prices. Clients can therefore save on electricity bills by reducing the coincident peak demand.

In this example we will train an `MSTL` (Multiple Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS) model on historic load data to forecast day-ahead peaks on September 2022. Multiple seasonality is traditionally present in low sampled electricity data. Demand exhibits daily and weekly seasonality, with clear patterns for specific hours of the day such as 6:00pm vs 3:00am or for specific days such as Sunday vs Friday.

First, we will load ERCOT historic demand, then we will use the `StatsForecast.cross_validation` method to fit the MSTL model and forecast daily load during September. Finally, we show how to use the forecasts to detect the coincident peak.

## Libraries

We assume you have StatsForecast already installed. Check this guide for instructions on [how to install StatsForecast](/statsforecast/getting-started/install).

Install the necessary packages using `pip install statsforecast`

## Load Data

The input to StatsForecast is always a data frame in [long format](https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/wide-and-long-data/) with three columns: `unique_id`, `ds` and `y`:

- The `unique_id` (string, int or category) represents an identifier for the series.
- The `ds` (datestamp or int) column should be either an integer indexing time or a datestamp ideally like YYYY-MM-DD for a date or YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS for a timestamp.
- The `y` (numeric) represents the measurement we wish to forecast. We will rename the

First, download and read the 2022 historic total demand of the ERCOT market, available [here](https://www.ercot.com/gridinfo/load/load_hist). The data processing includes adding the missing hour due to daylight saving time, parsing the date to datetime format, and filtering columns of interest. This step should take around 2s.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
```

```cs
# Load data
historic = pd.read_csv('./Native_Load_2022.csv')
# Add missing hour due to daylight saving time
historic = pd.concat([historic, pd.DataFrame({'Hour Ending':['03/13/2022 03:00'], 'ERCOT':['43980.57']})])
historic = historic.sort_values('Hour Ending').reset_index(drop=True)
# Convert to datetime
historic['ERCOT'] = historic['ERCOT'].str.replace(',','').astype(float)
historic = historic[~pd.isna(historic['ERCOT'])]
historic['ds'] = pd.to_datetime(historic['Hour Ending'].str[:10]) + pd.to_timedelta(np.tile(range(24), len(historic)//24),'h')
historic['unique_id'] = 'ERCOT'
historic['y'] = historic['ERCOT']
# Select relevant columns and dates
Y_df = historic[['unique_id', 'ds', 'y']]
Y_df = Y_df[Y_df['ds']<='2022-10-01']
```

Plot the series using the `plot` method from the `StatsForecast` class. This method prints up to 8 random series from the dataset and is useful for basic EDA.

<Info>
  The `StatsForecast.plot` method uses Plotly as a default engine. You can
  change to MatPlotLib by setting `engine="matplotlib"`.

```java
from statsforecast import StatsForecast

StatsForecast.plot(Y_df)
```

We observe that the time series exhibits seasonal patterns. Moreover, the time series contains `6,552` observations, so it is necessary to use computationally efficient methods to deploy them in production.

## Fit and Forecast MSTL model

The MSTL (Multiple Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS) model decomposes the time series in multiple seasonalities using a Local Polynomial Regression (LOESS). Then it forecasts the trend using a custom non-seasonal model and each seasonality using a SeasonalNaive model.

<Tip>
  Check our detailed explanation and tutorial on MSTL
  [here](/statsforecast/tutorials/multiple-seasonalities)
</Tip>

Import the `StatsForecast` class and the models you need.

```java
from statsforecast import StatsForecast
from statsforecast.models import MSTL, AutoARIMA
```

First, instantiate the model and define the parameters. The electricity load presents seasonalities every 24 hours (Hourly) and every 24 * 7 (Daily) hours. Therefore, we will use `[24, 24 * 7]` as the seasonalities. See [this link](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/seasonal-periods/) for a detailed explanation on how to set seasonal lengths. In this example we use the `AutoARIMA` model for the trend component, however, any StatsForecast model can be used. The complete list of models is available here.
